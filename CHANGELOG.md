Mapbox welcomes participation and contributions from everyone.

## main

### Features ‚ú® and improvements üèÅ

- Annotations now will persist across style changes by default. ([#475](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/475))

### Breaking changes ‚ö†Ô∏è

- MapboxMaps now pins exactly to `MapboxCommon`. ([#481](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/481))

## 10.0.0-rc.1 - June 9, 2021

**The Mapbox Maps SDK for iOS has moved to release candidate status and is now ready for production use.**

### Breaking changes ‚ö†Ô∏è

- Converted `MapSnapshotOptions` to a struct. ([#430](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/430))
- Removed `CacheManager`. In the following releases, an API to control temporary map data may be provided. ([#440](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/440))
- Changed `ResourceOptions.cachePathURL` to `dataPathURL` and removed `cacheSize`. ([#440](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/440))
- Annotations don't have a `type` property since they can be directly compared to a type. ([451](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/451))
- Internalize extensions of Core and Common types. ([#449](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/449))

### Features ‚ú® and improvements üèÅ
- Allows a developer to choose whether the puck is oriented based on `heading` or `course` via a new `puckBearingSource` option in `mapView.location.options`. By default, the puck will be oriented using `heading`. ([#428](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/428))
- All stock gesture recognizers are now public on the `GestureManager`. ([450](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/450))
- The tap gesture recognizer controlled by any given annotation manager is now public. ([451](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/451))

### Bug fixes üêû

- Fixed a bug where animations were not always honored. ([#443](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/443))
- Fixed an issue that vertical text was not positioned correctly if the `text-offset` property was used. ([#440](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/440))
- Emit `.mapLoadingError` when an empty token is provided for accessing Mapbox data sources. Before the fix, the application may crash if an empty token was provided and map tries to load data from Mapbox data source. ([#440](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/440))
- Do not emit `.mapLoadingError` when an empty URL is set to GeoJSON source. ([#440](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/440))

### Dependencies

- Updated MapboxCoreMaps, MapboxCommon and Turf dependencies. ([#440](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/440))

  - Removed the `MBX` prefix from `MBXGeometry`, `MBXGeometryType` and `MBXFeature`. Existing uses of the similar Turf types need to be fully namespaced, i.e. `Turf.Feature`
  - Introduced separate minZoom/maxZoom fields into CustomGeometrySourceOptions API instead of the formerly used `zoomRange`
  - Improved zooming performance.
  - Fixed terrain transparency issue when a sky layer is not used.
- `MapboxMap.__map` is now private. ([#374](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/374))
- Added `CameraManagerProtocol.setCameraBounds`, `MapboxMap.prefetchZoomDelta`, `MapboxMap.options`, `MapboxMap.reduceMemoryUse()`, `MapboxMap.resourceOptions` and `MapboxMap.elevation(at:)`. ([#374](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/374))

- Updated the ambient cache path. ([#396](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/396))
- Removed `CameraAnimationsManager.setCamera()` and renamed `CameraManagerProtocol._setCamera` to `CameraManagerProtocol.setCamera()`. Use `MapView.mapboxMap.setCamera()` to set the camera. ([#426](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/426))
- Removed `MapCameraOptions` and `RenderOptions`; this behavior has moved to both `MapboxMap` and `MapView`. ([#427](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/427/files))
- The Annotations library has been rebuilt to expose many more customization options for each annotation. ([#398](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/398))

 - `MapView` has been coalesced into `BaseMapView` and the resulting object is called `MapView`. ([#353](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/353))
 - `Style.uri` is now an optional property. ([#347](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/347))
 - `Style` is no longer a dependency on `LocationSupportableMapView`. ([#352](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/352))
 - `Style` now has a more flat structure. `Layout` and `Paint` structs are now obsolete and `Layer` properties are at the root layer. ([#362](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/362))
 - Changed `LayerPosition` to an enum. ([#](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/221))
 - Removed `style` from MapView; updated tests and examples to use `mapboxMap.style`. ([#361](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/361))
 - The `visibleFeatures` APIs have been renamed to `queryRenderedFeatures`. ([#361](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/361))
 - `LoggingConfiguration` is no longer public. ([#361](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/361))
 - The following Swift wrappers have been added for existing types; these primarily change callbacks from using an internal `MBXExpected` type to using Swift's `Result` type. ([#361](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/361))
     - `CacheManager`

### Bug fixes üêû

  - Fixed an issue where location pucks would not be rendered. ([#331](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/331))

## 10.0.0-beta.19 - May 6, 2021

### Breaking changes ‚ö†Ô∏è

- `camera(for:)` methods have moved from `BaseMapView` to `MapboxMap` ([#286](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/286))
  * The API has also been aligned with Android by:
      * Removing default values for parameters
      * Making `bearing` and `pitch` parameters optional
      * Adding the `camera(for:camera:rect:)` variant
- `OrnamentOptions` should now be accessed via `MapView.ornaments.options`. `MapConfig.ornaments` has been removed. Updates can be applied directly to `OrnamentsManager.options`. Previously the map's ornament options were updated on `MapConfig.ornaments` with `MapView.update`. ([#310](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/310))
- `OrnamentOptions` now uses structs to manage options for individual ornaments. For example, `OrnamentOptions.scaleBarPosition` is now `OrnamentOptions.scaleBar.position`. ([#318](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/318))
- The `LogoView` class is now private. ([#310](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/310))
- `Style` has been significantly refactored, for example:
  - Synchronous APIs returning `Result` types now throw.
  - A number of APIs previously accessed via `__map` are now available via the `Style` object.
  - APIs with a `get` prefix have been renamed; for example `getLayer<T>(with:type:)` to `layer<T>(withId:type:) throws` and `getSource<T>(id:type:)` to `source<T>(withId:type:) throws`

### Features ‚ú® and improvements üèÅ

- `OrnamentsManager` is now a public class and can be accessed via the `MapView`'s `ornaments` property.
- `CompassDirectionFormatter` is now public. It provides a string representation of a `CLLocationDirection` and supports the same languages as in pre-v10 versions of the Maps SDK. ([#300](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/300))- `OrnamentOptions` should now be accessed via `MapView.ornaments.options`. Updates can be applied directly to the `options` property. Previously the map's ornament options were updated via `MapConfig.ornaments`. ([#310](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/310))
- The `LogoView` class is now private. ([#310](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/310))

## 10.0.0-beta.18.1 - April 28, 2021

### Breaking changes ‚ö†Ô∏è

- #### Camera Animations
  * A new `CameraTransition` struct has been introduced to allow better control on the "from" and "to" values of a camera animation ([#282](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/282))
     * A mutable version of the `CameraTransition` struct is passed into every animation block.
  * Animations can only be constructor injected into `CameraAnimator` as part of the `makeAnimator*` methods on `mapView.camera`.
  * The `makeCameraAnimator*` methods have been renamed to `makeAnimator*` methods

- #### Gestures
  - Gestures now directly call `__map.setCamera()` instead of using CoreAnimation

## 10.0.0-beta.18 - April 23, 2021

### Breaking changes ‚ö†Ô∏è

- #### `MapView`
  * The initializer has changed to `public init(frame: CGRect, mapInitOptions: MapInitOptions = MapInitOptions(), styleURI: StyleURI? = .streets)`.
  * `MapOptions` has been renamed `MapConfig`. A new `MapOptions` has been introduced; its properties are required to initialize the underlying map object.
  * A `MapInitOptions` configuration struct has been introduced. It currently wraps both `ResourceOptions` and `MapOptions` and is used when initializing a `MapView`.
  * `baseURL` and `accessToken` can no longer be set from a nib or storyboard. Instead a new `MapInitOptionsProvider` protocol and an `IBOutlet` on `MapView` has been introduced to allow a customer `MapInitOptions` to be provided to the `MapView`. This provider is not used when initializing a `MapView` programmatically.
  * The `Manager` suffix has been removed from `MapView.gesturesManager`, `MapView.ornamentsManager`, `MapView.cameraManager`, `MapView.locationManager`, and `MapView.annotationsManager`.
  * `BaseMapView.camera` has been renamed to `BaseMapView.cameraOptions`.

- #### Foundation
  * `AccountManager` has been removed. A new `CredentialsManager` replaces it. You can use `CredentialsManager.default` to set a global access token.
  * MapboxCoreMaps protocol conformances have been encapsulated. ([#265](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/265))
      * `ObserverConcrete` has been removed.
      * `BaseMapView` no longer conforms to `MapClient` or `MBMMetalViewProvider`, and the methods they required are now internal.
      * The setter for `BaseMapView.__map` is now private
      * `Snapshotter` no longer conforms to `Observer`, and the method it required is now internal.
  * The `BaseMapView.__map` property has been moved to `BaseMapView.mapboxMap.__map`. ([#280](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/280))
  * A `CameraOptions` struct has been introduced. This shadows the class of the same name from MapboxCoreMaps and. This avoids unintended sharing and better reflects the intended value semantics of the `CameraOptions` concept. ([#284](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/284))  

- #### Dependencies
  * Updated dependencies to MapboxCoreMaps 10.0.0-beta.20 and MapboxCommon 11.0.1
  * ResourceOptions now contains a `TileStore` instance. Tile store usage is enabled by default, the resource option `tileStoreEnabled` flag is introduced to disable it.  
  * `TileStore` no longer returns cached responses for 401, 403 and unauthorized requests.
  * Fixed a bug where `TileStore` would not invoke completion closures (when client code did not keep a strong reference to the tile store instance).


### Features ‚ú® and improvements üèÅ

- Introduced the `OfflineManager` API that manages style packs and produces tileset descriptors for use with the tile store. The `OfflineManager` and `TileStore` APIs are used in conjunction to download offline regions and associated "style packs". These new APIs replace the deprecated `OfflineRegionManager`. Please see the new `OfflineManager` guide for more details.

### Bug fixes üêû

- Fixed a crash in line layer rendering, where the uniform buffer size had an incorrect value.

- `AnnotationSupportableMap` is now internal ([#246](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/246))

- #### MapView
    * Initializer has been changed to `public init(frame: CGRect, resourceOptions: ResourceOptions, glyphsRasterizationOptions: GlyphsRasterizationOptions = GlyphsRasterizationOptions.default, styleURI: StyleURI? = .streets)`.
    * `StyleURL` has been renamed to `StyleURI`
    * `OrnamentSupportableMapView` is not internal.

- #### Ornaments
    * `LayoutPosition` has been deprecated in favor of `OrnamentPosition`.
    * `LayoutVisibility` has been deprecated in favor of `OrnamentVisibility`.
    * `showsLogoView` has been renamed to `_showsLogoView`.
    * `showsCompass` and `showsScale` have been deprecated. Visibility properties can be used to set how the Compass and Scale Bar should be shown.

- #### Foundation
    * `cancelTransitions` has been renamed to `cancelAnimations`.
    * [`setCamera()`](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/250/files#diff-8fa667141ac423a208a6e7036ed759e7e52fc6940bd58834c1935c2c6ead9c65L177) with individual parameters has been deprecated in favor of [`setCamera(to targetCamera: CameraOptions...)`](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/blob/edbf08e37975c81c7ee1cbc4bb046c48d522d306/Sources/MapboxMaps/Foundation/Camera/CameraManager.swift#L140) which requires `CameraOptions`.
    * The following camera convenience functions have been removed:
        * `public func transitionCoordinateBounds(newCoordinateBounds: CoordinateBounds, animated: Bool = false)`
        * `public func transitionCoordinateBounds(to newCoordinateBounds: CoordinateBounds, edgePadding: UIEdgeInsets, animated: Bool = false, completion: ((UIViewAnimatingPosition) -> Void)? = nil)`
        * `public func transitionVisibleCoordinates(newCoordinates: [CLLocationCoordinate2D], edgePadding: UIEdgeInsets, animated: Bool = false)`
        * `public func transitionVisibleCoordinates(to newCoordinates: [CLLocationCoordinate2D], edgePadding: UIEdgeInsets, bearing: CLLocationDirection, duration: TimeInterval, animated: Bool = false, completion: ((UIViewAnimatingPosition) -> Void)? = nil)`
        * `public func resetPosition()`
        * `public func resetNorth(_ animated: Bool = false)`
    * In `CameraAnimator`, `fractionComplete` is now of type `Double` and `delayFactor` now returns a `Double`.
    * `MapboxLogoView` has been renamed to `LogoView`.
    * `MapboxLogoSize` has been renamed to `LogoSize`.

- #### Style
    * Initializer is now marked as internal.
    * `styleUri` property has been renamed to `uri`.
    * The `url` property from `StyleURL` has been removed.

- #### Expressions
    * `init(from: jsonObject)` and `public func jsonObject()` have been removed.
    * `Element.op` has been renamed to `Element.operator`.
    * `Argument.array` has been renamed to `Argument.numberArray`.
    * `ValidExpressionArgument` has been renamed to `ExpressionArgumentConvertible`

    (addStyleLayer, addStyleSource, etc.).
  * Minimize the effort for addition of new events.
  * Expose experimental events.
  * Suppress events that a developer hasn't subscribed to.
