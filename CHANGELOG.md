### Breaking changes ‚ö†Ô∏è

- #### `MapView`
  * The initializer has changed to `public init(frame: CGRect, mapInitOptions: MapInitOptions = MapInitOptions(), styleURI: StyleURI? = .streets)`.
  * `MapOptions` has been renamed `MapConfig`. A new `MapOptions` has been introduced; its properties are required to initialize the underlying map object.
  * A `MapInitOptions` configuration struct has been introduced. It currently wraps both `ResourceOptions` and `MapOptions` and is used when initializing a `MapView`.
  * `baseURL` and `accessToken` can no longer be set from a nib or storyboard. Instead a new `MapInitOptionsProvider` protocol and an `IBOutlet` on `MapView` has been introduced to allow a customer `MapInitOptions` to be provided to the `MapView`. This provider is not used when initializing a `MapView` programmatically.
  * The `Manager` suffix has been removed from `MapView.gesturesManager`, `MapView.ornamentsManager`, `MapView.cameraManager`, `MapView.locationManager`, and `MapView.annotationsManager`.
  * `BaseMapView.camera` has been renamed to `BaseMapView.cameraOptions`.

- #### Foundation
  * `AccountManager` has been removed. A new `CredentialsManager` replaces it. You can use `CredentialsManager.default` to set a global access token.
  * MapboxCoreMaps protocol conformances have been encapsulated. ([#265](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/265))
      * `ObserverConcrete` has been removed.
      * `BaseMapView` no longer conforms to `MapClient` or `MBMMetalViewProvider`, and the methods they required are now internal.
      * The setter for `BaseMapView.__map` is now private
      * `Snapshotter` no longer conforms to `Observer`, and the method it required is now internal.
  * The `BaseMapView.__map` property has been moved to `BaseMapView.mapboxMap.__map`. ([#280](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/280))
  * A `CameraOptions` struct has been introduced. This shadows the class of the same name from MapboxCoreMaps and. This avoids unintended sharing and better reflects the intended value semantics of the `CameraOptions` concept. ([#284](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/284))

## 10.0.0-beta.17 - April 13, 2021

### Breaking changes ‚ö†Ô∏è

- `AnnotationSupportableMap` is now internal ([#246](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/246))

- #### MapView
    * Initializer has been changed to `public init(frame: CGRect, resourceOptions: ResourceOptions, glyphsRasterizationOptions: GlyphsRasterizationOptions = GlyphsRasterizationOptions.default, styleURI: StyleURI? = .streets)`.
    * `StyleURL` has been renamed to `StyleURI`

- #### Foundation
    * `cancelTransitions` has been renamed to `cancelAnimations`.
    * [`setCamera()`](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/250/files#diff-8fa667141ac423a208a6e7036ed759e7e52fc6940bd58834c1935c2c6ead9c65L177) with individual parameters has been deprecated in favor of [`setCamera(to targetCamera: CameraOptions...)`](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/blob/edbf08e37975c81c7ee1cbc4bb046c48d522d306/Sources/MapboxMaps/Foundation/Camera/CameraManager.swift#L140) which requires `CameraOptions`.
    * The following camera convenience functions have been removed:
        * `public func transitionCoordinateBounds(newCoordinateBounds: CoordinateBounds, animated: Bool = false)`
        * `public func transitionCoordinateBounds(to newCoordinateBounds: CoordinateBounds, edgePadding: UIEdgeInsets, animated: Bool = false, completion: ((UIViewAnimatingPosition) -> Void)? = nil)`
        * `public func transitionVisibleCoordinates(newCoordinates: [CLLocationCoordinate2D], edgePadding: UIEdgeInsets, animated: Bool = false)`
        * `public func transitionVisibleCoordinates(to newCoordinates: [CLLocationCoordinate2D], edgePadding: UIEdgeInsets, bearing: CLLocationDirection, duration: TimeInterval, animated: Bool = false, completion: ((UIViewAnimatingPosition) -> Void)? = nil)`
        * `public func resetPosition()`
        * `public func resetNorth(_ animated: Bool = false)`
    * In `CameraAnimator`, `fractionComplete` is now of type `Double` and `delayFactor` now returns a `Double`.
    * `MapboxLogoView` has been renamed to `LogoView`.
    * `MapboxLogoSize` has been renamed to `LogoSize`.

- #### Style
    * Initializer is now marked as internal.
    * `styleUri` property has been renamed to `uri`.
    * The `url` property from `StyleURL` has been removed.

- #### Expressions
    * `init(from: jsonObject)` and `public func jsonObject()` have been removed.
    * `Element.op` has been renamed to `Element.operator`.
    * `Argument.array` has been renamed to `Argument.numberArray`.
    * `ValidExpressionArgument` has been renamed to `ExpressionArgumentConvertible`


### Bug fixes üêû

## 10.0.0-beta.16 - March 29, 2021

### Breaking changes ‚ö†Ô∏è

* The `CameraManager.moveCamera` method has been removed. ([#217](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/217))
* `UIView.animate` is no longer supported. Instead, use `CameraAnimators`. ([#217](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/217))
* Developers should make camera changes directly to `MapView`'s camera
  properties. Previously, changes could be applied to `MapView.cameraView`. ([#217](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/217))
* `CameraAnimator` objects are managed by developers and should be stored by
  developers to prevent the animations from falling out of scope.
* `LocationOptions.showUserLocation` has been removed. Use
  `LocationOptions.puckType` instead, setting it to `nil` if you do not want to
  show the user location. `LocationManager.showUserLocation` has also been
  removed. ([#203](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/203))
* Make model layer internal and refactor for increased public API clarity
  ([#194](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/194), [#198](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/198))
  * `ModelLayer` and `ModelSource` are now internal
  * `shouldTrackLocation` flag has been removed from `LocationConsumer` because
    it was never used
  * `PuckType.puck2D`'s associated value is now non-optional. It still has a
    default value corresponding to the previous behavior
  * `LocationPuckManager` is now internal
  * Renaming:
    * `LocationPuck` is now `PuckType`
    * `LocationOptions.locationPuck` is now `LocationOptions.puckType`
    * `LocationIndicatorLayerViewModel` is now `Puck2DConfiguration`
    * `PuckModelLayerViewModel` is now `Puck3DConfiguration`
* Updates dependencies to MapboxCoreMaps 10.0.0-beta.17 and MapboxCommon 10.0.2.
  ([#193](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/193))
  * [rendering] Query rendered features now work for fill-extrusions when
    terrain is enabled.
  * [rendering] Improved terrain rendering performance due to reduction of
    loaded tiles.
* All layer paint/layout properties can be defined via expressions ([#185](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/185))
* Added RawRepresentable conformance to StyleURL. Removed enum cases for older
  style versions. ([#168](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/168))

### Features ‚ú® and improvements üèÅ

* Introduced the platform-driven Drag API for shifting the map‚Äôs camera. ([#217](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/217))
* Introduced `CameraAnimator`, a UIViewPropertyAnimator-based class for
  animating camera changes. These animators should be created using
  `CameraManager.makeCameraAnimator` methods. ([#217](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/217))
* Gesture-driven camera changes have been updated to use camera animators. ([#217](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/217))
* The `AnimatorOwner` enum has been added to track owners for individual
  animators. ([#217](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/217))
* `CameraManager.fly(to:)` is now built on camera animators. `zoom`, `pitch`,
  `bearing`, and `centerCoordinate` keyframes are supported. ([#217](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/217))
* The getter for LocationManager.locationOptions is now public. ([#209](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/209))
* Added function to get layer identifier for an annotation type. ([#189](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/189))
* Add PreferredFPS.custom() to add support for custom preferred frames per
  second values. ([#157](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/157))

### Bug fixes üêû
