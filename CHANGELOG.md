* `public func updateLayer<T: Layer>(withId id: String, update: (inout T) throws -> Void) throws` has been updated to `public func updateLayer<T>(withId id: String, type: T.Type, update: (inout T) throws -> Void) throws where T: Layer`. ([#694](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/694))
* `public func source<T: Source>(withId id: String) throws -> T` has been updated to `public func source<T>(withId id: String, type: T.Type) throws -> T where T: Source`. ([#694](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/694))
* `@_spi(Experimental) public func layer(withId id: String, type: Layer.Type) throws -> Layer` is no longer experimental and has been updated to `public func layer(withId id: String) throws -> Layer`. ([#694](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/694))
* `@_spi(Experimental) public func source(withId id: String, type: Source.Type) throws  -> Source` is no longer experimental and has been updated to `public func source(withId id: String) throws  -> Source`. ([#694](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/694))
* `GestureManagerDelegate.gestureBegan(for:)` has been renamed to `GestureManagerDelegate.gestureManager(_:didBegin:)`. ([#697](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/697))
* Added the public delegate methods `GestureManagerDelegate.gestureManager(_:didEnd:willAnimate:)` and `GestureManagerDelegate.gestureManager(_:didEndAnimatingFor:)`. ([#697](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/697))
* Converts `PointAnnotation.Image` from an `enum` to a `struct`. ([#707](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/707))
* Removes `PointAnnotation.Image.default`. ([#707](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/707))

* Renames `Style.updateGeoJSONSource<T: GeoJSONObject>(withId:geoJSON:)` to `Style.updateGeoJSONSource(withId:geoJSON:)`. Instead of passing in the expected GeoJSON object type, you perform pattern matching on the return value using `case let`. ([#715](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/715))
* Setting `data` property on a GeoJSON source via `Style.setSourceProperty(for:property:value:)` or `Style.updateGeoJSONSource(withId:geoJSON:)` is now asynchronous and never returns an error. Errors will be reported asynchronously via a `MapEvents.EventKind.mapLoadingError` event instead. ([#732](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/732))
* Core and Common APIs that accept user-defined implementations of protocols now hold strong references to the provided objects. Please audit your usage of the following protocols and make any required changes to avoid memory leaks: `CustomLayerHost`, `ElevationData`, `MapClient`, `MBMMetalViewProvider`, `Observer`, `OfflineRegionObserver`, `HttpServiceInterceptorInterface`, `HttpServiceInterface`, `LogWriterBackend`, `OfflineSwitchObserver`, `ReachabilityInterface`, `TileStoreObserver`. ([#732](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/732))

* Annotation managers are now kept alive by the `AnnotationOrchestrator` (`MapView.annotations`) until they are explicitly destroyed by calling `mapView.annotations.removeAnnotationManager(withId:)` or are implicitly destroyed by creating a second annotation manager with the same ID. ([#725](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/725))
* The `AnnotationManager` protocol now conforms to `AnyObject`. ([#725](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/725))
* `PreferredFPS` has been removed. `MapView.preferredFramesPerSecond` now of type `Int`, rather than `PreferredFPS`. ([#735](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/735))
* `QueriedFeature.feature` is no longer optional. ([#737](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/737))
* `TypeConversionError` has a new case `unsuccessfulConversion`. ([#737](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/737))

### Features ✨ and improvements 🏁

* Adds `FeatureExtensionValue.init(value: Any?, features: [Feature]?)` that works with Turf. ([#717](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/717))
* Adds `FeatureExtensionValue.features: [Feature]?` that works with Turf. ([#717](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/717))
* APIs that accept Turf `Feature` now allow `Feature.identifier` and `.properties` to be `nil`. ([#717](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/717))
* APIs that accept Turf `Feature` now ignore `Feature.properties` instead of crashing if it cannot be converted to `[String: NSObject]`. ([#717](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/717))
* Any touch event in the map now immediately disables camera animation. Temporarily disable user interaction on the `MapView` to disable this behavior as needed. ([#712](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/712))
* `BasicCameraAnimator` no longer updates the camera a final time after being stopped or canceled prior to running to completion. ([#712](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/712))
* `BasicCameraAnimator.isReversed` is now settable. ([#712](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/712))
* The double tap, quick zoom, and double touch gestures now use the gesture's location in the view to anchor camera changes. Previously, they used the camera's center coordinate. ([#722](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/722))
* `MapboxCommon.HTTPServiceFactory.reset()` has been added to release the HTTP service implementation. ([#732](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/732))

* Adds `MapView.preferredFrameRateRange` for devices using iOS 15.0 and up. ([#735](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/735))
* Adds `TileStore.subscribe(_:)` which can be used to observe a `TileStore`'s activity. The API design deviates from Android's add/remove observer API so that the developer-provided `TileStoreObserver` can be wrapped into a `MapboxCommon_Private.TileStoreObserver` without needing to use global state or something like Objective-C associated objects to look up which wrapper goes with with developer-provided observer when calling `__removeObserver`. ([#737](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/737))
* Adds `TileStoreObserver` protocol. ([#737](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/737))

## 10.0.0-rc.2 - June 23, 2021

### Features ✨ and improvements 🏁

* Introduced experimental `Style._addPersistentLayer(with:layerPosition:)`, `Style._isPersistentLayer(id:)`, `Style._addPersistentCustomLayer(withId:layerHost:layerPosition:)` APIs, so that the tagged layer and its associated resources remain when a style is reloaded. This improves performance of annotations during a style change. Experimental APIs should be considered liable to change in any SEMVER version. ([#471](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/471), [#473](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/473))
- Annotations now will persist across style changes by default. ([#475](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/475))
- Adds localization support for v10 Maps SDK. This can be used by setting the `mapView.locale`. Use the `SupportedLanguages` enum, which lists currently supported `Locale`. ([#480](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/480))

 - `MapView` has been coalesced into `BaseMapView` and the resulting object is called `MapView`. ([#353](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/353))
 - `Style.uri` is now an optional property. ([#347](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/347))
 - `Style` is no longer a dependency on `LocationSupportableMapView`. ([#352](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/352))
 - `Style` now has a more flat structure. `Layout` and `Paint` structs are now obsolete and `Layer` properties are at the root layer. ([#362](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/362))
 - Changed `LayerPosition` to an enum. ([#](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/221))

      * Making `bearing` and `pitch` parameters optional
      * Adding the `camera(for:camera:rect:)` variant
- `OrnamentOptions` should now be accessed via `MapView.ornaments.options`. `MapConfig.ornaments` has been removed. Updates can be applied directly to `OrnamentsManager.options`. Previously the map's ornament options were updated on `MapConfig.ornaments` with `MapView.update`. ([#310](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/310))
- `OrnamentOptions` now uses structs to manage options for individual ornaments. For example, `OrnamentOptions.scaleBarPosition` is now `OrnamentOptions.scaleBar.position`. ([#318](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/318))
- The `LogoView` class is now private. ([#310](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/310))
- `Style` has been significantly refactored, for example:
  - Synchronous APIs returning `Result` types now throw.
  - A number of APIs previously accessed via `__map` are now available via the `Style` object.
  - APIs with a `get` prefix have been renamed; for example `getLayer<T>(with:type:)` to `layer<T>(withId:type:) throws` and `getSource<T>(id:type:)` to `source<T>(withId:type:) throws`

### Features ✨ and improvements 🏁

- `OrnamentsManager` is now a public class and can be accessed via the `MapView`'s `ornaments` property.
- `CompassDirectionFormatter` is now public. It provides a string representation of a `CLLocationDirection` and supports the same languages as in pre-v10 versions of the Maps SDK. ([#300](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/300))- `OrnamentOptions` should now be accessed via `MapView.ornaments.options`. Updates can be applied directly to the `options` property. Previously the map's ornament options were updated via `MapConfig.ornaments`. ([#310](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/310))
- The `LogoView` class is now private. ([#310](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/310))

## 10.0.0-beta.18.1 - April 28, 2021

### Breaking changes ⚠️

- #### Camera Animations
  * A new `CameraTransition` struct has been introduced to allow better control on the "from" and "to" values of a camera animation ([#282](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/282))
     * A mutable version of the `CameraTransition` struct is passed into every animation block.
  * Animations can only be constructor injected into `CameraAnimator` as part of the `makeAnimator*` methods on `mapView.camera`.
  * The `makeCameraAnimator*` methods have been renamed to `makeAnimator*` methods

- #### Gestures
  - Gestures now directly call `__map.setCamera()` instead of using CoreAnimation

## 10.0.0-beta.18 - April 23, 2021

### Breaking changes ⚠️

- #### `MapView`
  * The initializer has changed to `public init(frame: CGRect, mapInitOptions: MapInitOptions = MapInitOptions(), styleURI: StyleURI? = .streets)`.
  * `MapOptions` has been renamed `MapConfig`. A new `MapOptions` has been introduced; its properties are required to initialize the underlying map object.
  * A `MapInitOptions` configuration struct has been introduced. It currently wraps both `ResourceOptions` and `MapOptions` and is used when initializing a `MapView`.
  * `baseURL` and `accessToken` can no longer be set from a nib or storyboard. Instead a new `MapInitOptionsProvider` protocol and an `IBOutlet` on `MapView` has been introduced to allow a customer `MapInitOptions` to be provided to the `MapView`. This provider is not used when initializing a `MapView` programmatically.
  * The `Manager` suffix has been removed from `MapView.gesturesManager`, `MapView.ornamentsManager`, `MapView.cameraManager`, `MapView.locationManager`, and `MapView.annotationsManager`.
  * `BaseMapView.camera` has been renamed to `BaseMapView.cameraOptions`.

- #### Foundation
  * `AccountManager` has been removed. A new `CredentialsManager` replaces it. You can use `CredentialsManager.default` to set a global access token.
  * MapboxCoreMaps protocol conformances have been encapsulated. ([#265](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/265))
      * `ObserverConcrete` has been removed.
      * `BaseMapView` no longer conforms to `MapClient` or `MBMMetalViewProvider`, and the methods they required are now internal.
      * The setter for `BaseMapView.__map` is now private
      * `Snapshotter` no longer conforms to `Observer`, and the method it required is now internal.
  * The `BaseMapView.__map` property has been moved to `BaseMapView.mapboxMap.__map`. ([#280](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/280))
  * A `CameraOptions` struct has been introduced. This shadows the class of the same name from MapboxCoreMaps and. This avoids unintended sharing and better reflects the intended value semantics of the `CameraOptions` concept. ([#284](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/284))

- #### Dependencies
  * Updated dependencies to MapboxCoreMaps 10.0.0-beta.20 and MapboxCommon 11.0.1
  * ResourceOptions now contains a `TileStore` instance. Tile store usage is enabled by default, the resource option `tileStoreEnabled` flag is introduced to disable it.
  * `TileStore` no longer returns cached responses for 401, 403 and unauthorized requests.
  * Fixed a bug where `TileStore` would not invoke completion closures (when client code did not keep a strong reference to the tile store instance).


### Features ✨ and improvements 🏁

- Introduced the `OfflineManager` API that manages style packs and produces tileset descriptors for use with the tile store. The `OfflineManager` and `TileStore` APIs are used in conjunction to download offline regions and associated "style packs". These new APIs replace the deprecated `OfflineRegionManager`. Please see the new `OfflineManager` guide for more details.

### Bug fixes 🐞

- Fixed a crash in line layer rendering, where the uniform buffer size had an incorrect value.

## 10.0.0-beta.17 - April 13, 2021

- `AnnotationSupportableMap` is now internal ([#246](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/246))

- #### MapView
    * Initializer has been changed to `public init(frame: CGRect, resourceOptions: ResourceOptions, glyphsRasterizationOptions: GlyphsRasterizationOptions = GlyphsRasterizationOptions.default, styleURI: StyleURI? = .streets)`.
    * `StyleURL` has been renamed to `StyleURI`
    * `OrnamentSupportableMapView` is not internal.

- #### Ornaments
    * `LayoutPosition` has been deprecated in favor of `OrnamentPosition`.
    * `LayoutVisibility` has been deprecated in favor of `OrnamentVisibility`.
    * `showsLogoView` has been renamed to `_showsLogoView`.
    * `showsCompass` and `showsScale` have been deprecated. Visibility properties can be used to set how the Compass and Scale Bar should be shown.

- #### Foundation
    * `cancelTransitions` has been renamed to `cancelAnimations`.
    * [`setCamera()`](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/250/files#diff-8fa667141ac423a208a6e7036ed759e7e52fc6940bd58834c1935c2c6ead9c65L177) with individual parameters has been deprecated in favor of [`setCamera(to targetCamera: CameraOptions...)`](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/blob/edbf08e37975c81c7ee1cbc4bb046c48d522d306/Sources/MapboxMaps/Foundation/Camera/CameraManager.swift#L140) which requires `CameraOptions`.
    * The following camera convenience functions have been removed:
        * `public func transitionCoordinateBounds(newCoordinateBounds: CoordinateBounds, animated: Bool = false)`
        * `public func transitionCoordinateBounds(to newCoordinateBounds: CoordinateBounds, edgePadding: UIEdgeInsets, animated: Bool = false, completion: ((UIViewAnimatingPosition) -> Void)? = nil)`
        * `public func transitionVisibleCoordinates(newCoordinates: [CLLocationCoordinate2D], edgePadding: UIEdgeInsets, animated: Bool = false)`
        * `public func transitionVisibleCoordinates(to newCoordinates: [CLLocationCoordinate2D], edgePadding: UIEdgeInsets, bearing: CLLocationDirection, duration: TimeInterval, animated: Bool = false, completion: ((UIViewAnimatingPosition) -> Void)? = nil)`
        * `public func resetPosition()`
        * `public func resetNorth(_ animated: Bool = false)`
    * In `CameraAnimator`, `fractionComplete` is now of type `Double` and `delayFactor` now returns a `Double`.
    * `MapboxLogoView` has been renamed to `LogoView`.
    * `MapboxLogoSize` has been renamed to `LogoSize`.

- #### Style
    * Initializer is now marked as internal.
    * `styleUri` property has been renamed to `uri`.
    * The `url` property from `StyleURL` has been removed.

- #### Expressions
    * `init(from: jsonObject)` and `public func jsonObject()` have been removed.
    * `Element.op` has been renamed to `Element.operator`.
    * `Argument.array` has been renamed to `Argument.numberArray`.
    * `ValidExpressionArgument` has been renamed to `ExpressionArgumentConvertible`

### Breaking changes ⚠️

* The `CameraManager.moveCamera` method has been removed. ([#217](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/217))
* `UIView.animate` is no longer supported. Instead, use `CameraAnimators`. ([#217](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/217))
* Developers should make camera changes directly to `MapView`'s camera
  properties. Previously, changes could be applied to `MapView.cameraView`. ([#217](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/217))
* `CameraAnimator` objects are managed by developers and should be stored by
  developers to prevent the animations from falling out of scope.
* `LocationOptions.showUserLocation` has been removed. Use
  `LocationOptions.puckType` instead, setting it to `nil` if you do not want to
  show the user location. `LocationManager.showUserLocation` has also been
  removed. ([#203](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/203))
* Make model layer internal and refactor for increased public API clarity
  ([#194](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/194), [#198](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/198))

  * `shouldTrackLocation` flag has been removed from `LocationConsumer` because
    it was never used
  * `PuckType.puck2D`'s associated value is now non-optional. It still has a
    default value corresponding to the previous behavior

  * Renaming:
    * `LocationPuck` is now `PuckType`
    * `LocationOptions.locationPuck` is now `LocationOptions.puckType`
    * `LocationIndicatorLayerViewModel` is now `Puck2DConfiguration`
    * `PuckModelLayerViewModel` is now `Puck3DConfiguration`
* Updates dependencies to MapboxCoreMaps 10.0.0-beta.17 and MapboxCommon 10.0.2.
  ([#193](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/193))
  * [rendering] Query rendered features now work for fill-extrusions when
    terrain is enabled.
  * [rendering] Improved terrain rendering performance due to reduction of
    loaded tiles.
* All layer paint/layout properties can be defined via expressions ([#185](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/185))
* Added RawRepresentable conformance to StyleURL. Removed enum cases for older
  style versions. ([#168](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/168))

### Features ✨ and improvements 🏁

* Introduced the platform-driven Drag API for shifting the map’s camera. ([#217](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/217))
* Introduced `CameraAnimator`, a UIViewPropertyAnimator-based class for
  animating camera changes. These animators should be created using
  `CameraManager.makeCameraAnimator` methods. ([#217](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/217))
* Gesture-driven camera changes have been updated to use camera animators. ([#217](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/217))

  animators. ([#217](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/217))
* `CameraManager.fly(to:)` is now built on camera animators. `zoom`, `pitch`,
  `bearing`, and `centerCoordinate` keyframes are supported. ([#217](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/217))
* The getter for LocationManager.locationOptions is now public. ([#209](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/209))
* Added function to get layer identifier for an annotation type. ([#189](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/189))

* The above breaking change introduces the new Map Events API which will:
  * Simplify the Map API and align it with other weakly typed interfaces
    (addStyleLayer, addStyleSource, etc.).
  * Minimize the effort for addition of new events.
  * Expose experimental events.
  * Suppress events that a developer hasn't subscribed to.
  * Automatically expose new events for Snapshotter (eliminating the need to
