## main

## 11.2.0-beta.1 - 1 February, 2024

### Features ‚ú® and improvements üèÅ

* Vision OS support. üöÄ
* Add easing curve parameter to `CameraAnimationsManager.fly(to:duration:curve:completion)`, make `TimingCurve` public with few more options.
* Expose `MapboxMap.centerAltitudeMode` and ensure correct `centerAltitudeMode` on gesture ending.
* Expose extra configuration methods for `MapboxMap`: `setNorthOrientation(_:)`, `setConstrainMode(_:)` and `setViewportMode(_:)`.
Use them to configure respective map options after creating a map view.
* Expose `MapboxMap.reduceMemoryUse()` which can be used in situations when it is important to keep the memory footprint minimal.
* Expose `MapboxMap.isAnimationInProgress` and `MapboxMap.isGestureInProgress` to query current status of both built-in and custom camera animations and gestures.
* Expose experimental `CustomRasterSource` and non-experimental `CustomGeometrySource` as regular `Source`'s providing a better way to work with them and also allow for using them in Style DSL.
* Introduce `tileCacheBudget` property on `GeoJsonSource`, `RasterSource`, `RasterDemSource`, `RasterArraySource`, `VectorSource`, `CustomGeometrySource`, and `CustomRasterSource`.
* `MapboxMaps/setTileCacheBudget(size:)` will now use the `TileCacheBudgetSize` property, the older method with `TileCacheBudget` has been deprecated and will be removed in a future major release.
* Introduce `SymbolLayer.iconColorSaturation` API.
* Introduce experimental `RasterLayer.rasterElevation` API.
* Introduce experimental `MapboxMap.collectPerformanceStatistics` allowing to collect map rendering performance statistics, both for UIKit and SwiftUI.

### Bug fixes üêû
* Fix MapView flickering during resizing.
* Fix glitch in chained camera animations.
* Build XCFramework with `SWIFT_SERIALIZE_DEBUGGING_OPTIONS=NO` flag to avoid serialized search paths in Swift modules.
* Fixed a crash that occurs when annotations have duplicate identifiers.

### Dependency Updates
* Bump Turf version to `2.8.0`.
* Bump minimum Xcode version to `14.3.1`.

## 11.1.0 - 17 January, 2024

* Add `customData` field in Annotaion and deprecate `userInfo`. `userInfo` behaviour rolled back to v10 behaviour.
* Fixed a bug where the attribution dialog does not appear when there is a presented view controller.
* Make padding optional in `MapboxMap.camera(for:padding:bearing:pitch:maxZoom:offset:)` and `MapboxMap.camera(for:padding:bearing:pitch:)`.
* Update CoreMaps to 11.1.0 and Common to 24.1.0

## 11.1.0-rc.1 - 04 January, 2024

### Bug fixes üêû

* Fix the bug where the annotation could disappear when it is dragged.

## 11.1.0-beta.1 - 19 December, 2023

‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

* `RasterArraySource.rasterLayers` is always `nil` for any source.
Workaround: use `MapboxMap.sourceProperty(for:property:).value` to fetch a value of `RasterArraySource.rasterLayers`.

* Expose method to get coordinate info for point(s): `MapboxMap.coordinateInfo(for:)` and `MapboxMap.coordinatesInfo(for:)`.
* [SwiftUI] Expose `Map.gestureHandlers()` for handling Map gesture events.
* Introduce experimental `RasterArraySource`, along with `RasterLayer.rasterArrayBand`.
* Introduce `-emissiveStrength` attribute for `FillExtrusionLayer`, `HillShadeLayer` and `RasterLayer`.
* Update MapboxCoreMaps to v11.1.0-beta.1 and MapboxCommon to v24.1.0-beta.2

## 11.0.0 - 29 November, 2023

* Introduce [`Slot`](https://docs.mapbox.com/ios/maps/api/11.0.0-rc.2/documentation/mapboxmaps/slot/) for assigning a layer to a slot.
* Update MapboxCoreMaps to v11.0.0 and MapboxCommon to v24.0.0

## 11.0.0-rc.2 - 17 November, 2023

### Breaking changes ‚ö†Ô∏è

- Note: SwiftUI support is an experimental feature, its API may be changed until it stabilizes.

* [SwiftUI] Fixed point annotations clustering.
* [SwiftUI] Viewport inset system was refactored:
  - The `Viewport.inset(...)` function was removed in favor of the `Viewport.padding(...)`
  - The `Viewport.inset(...)` previously had an `ignoringSafeArea` parameter which allowed developers to specify if an edge safe area inset should be accounted for in padding calculation. Starting with this version, instead of this parameter there is a `Map.usesSafeAreaInsetsAsPadding(_:)` modifier that enables or disables this for all edges.

### Features ‚ú® and improvements üèÅ
 * [SwiftUI] New `Map.additionalSafeAreaInsets(...)` modifier that adds additional global safe area insets for the map. Use them to display any UI elements on top of the map. The additional safe area will automatically be accounted for in camera padding calculation in every Viewport.
 * Added `allowOverlapWithPuck` and `ignoreCameraPadding` options to `ViewAnnotation` and `MapViewAnnotation`.

### Bug fixes üêû

* [SwiftUI] Fix bug when `Viewport.inset(...)` didn't use safe area insets on the first load.
* [SwiftUI] Fix map basic coordinator clinging to the first subscriptions.

## 11.0.0-rc.1 - 3 November, 2023

### Breaking changes ‚ö†Ô∏è

* `MapboxMap.loadStyle` methods changed error type from `MapLoadingError` to `Error`.
* `OverviewViewportStateOptions.coordinatesPadding` is renamed to `OverviewViewportStateOptions.geometryPadding`.
* [SwiftUI] ``Viewport.overview(geometry:bearing:pitch:coordinatesPadding:maxZoom:offset:)` is renamed to `Viewport.overview(geometry:bearing:pitch:geometryPadding:maxZoom:offset:)`
* Bearing indication on user location puck is disabled by default to reduce amount map redraws.
    To re-enable bearing update rendering, set `mapView.location.options.puckBearingEnabled` to `true`.
* The default behavior of resetting the viewport to idle is changed. Previously viewport was reset to idle when the user touched the map for longer than 150 ms. Now it will happen when the user pans the map. If the desired behavior is different, you can disable the default by setting `mapView.viewport.options.transitionsToIdleUponUserInteraction` to `false` and implementing any gesture that calls `mapView.viewport.idle()`.

### Features ‚ú® and improvements üèÅ

* Refactor `MapboxMap.loadStyle` to cancel previous style loads when called multiple times.
* New experimental `StyleManager.load(mapStyle:transition:completion)` method to load `MapStyle` in `MapboxMap`, or `Snapshotter`:
  ```swift
  mapboxMap.load(mapStyle: .standard(lightPreset: .dawn, showRoadLabels: false)) { _ in
    print("Style is loaded")
  }
  ```
* Support `slot` for annotation managers and annotation groups.
* [SwiftUI] Annotation groups can be created with static list of annotations. In the example below polyline annotation group displays two annotations on the same layer.
  ```swift
  Map {
      PolylineAnnotationGroup {
          PolylineAnnotation(lineCoordinates: route.coordinates)
              .lineColor("blue")
          if let alternativeRoute {
              PolylineAnnotation(lineCoordinates: alternativeRoute.coordinates)
                  .lineColor("green")
          }
      }
      .lineCap(.round)
      .slot("middle")
  }
  ```
* [SwiftUI] Expose `transitionsToIdleUponUserInteraction` modifier.
* Introduce typed API for assining a layer to a slot.
* Introduce `Slot` for assining a layer to a slot.
* Introduce [`Slot`](https://docs.mapbox.com/ios/maps/api/11.0.0-rc.1-docc/documentation/mapboxmaps/slot) for assigning a layer to a slot.

### Bug fixes üêû

* Fix issue where 2D puck images are not getting updates.
* [SwiftUI] Fixed issue when viewport inset with safe area is calculated incorrectly.
* Fixed issue when quick interaction didn't lead to resetting viewport to `idle`.

## 11.0.0-beta.6 - 23 October, 2023

### Breaking changes ‚ö†Ô∏è

* Style projection can be undefined for styles that do not explicitly specify it, so `MapboxMap.projection` has become optional.
* View Annotation API is changed:
  - `ViewAnnotationOptions.geometry` was removed in favor of `ViewAnnotationOptions.annotatedFeature`.
  - `ViewAnnotationOptions.associatedFeatureId` was removed. Use `AnnotatedFeature.layerFeature(layerId:featureId:)` with `ViewAnnotationOptions.annotatedFeature` to bind View Annotation to features rendered by any layer.
  - [SwiftUI] Use `MapViewAnnotation` instead of `ViewAnnotation` to display view annotations in SwiftUI.
* `OverviewViewportStateOptions.padding` is renamed to `OverviewViewportStateOptions.coordinatePadding`, the `OverviewViewportStateOptions.padding` now represents the camera padding.

### Features ‚ú® and improvements üèÅ

* New `ViewAnnotation` class is added for simplifying View Annotation management. It is a simple to use replacement for the old `ViewAnnotationOptions`. It automatically updates size and other properties of annotations, and provides new features:
  - Automatic anchor position from specified `ViewAnnotation.variableAnchor` configurations.
  - Supports displaying not only at point features, but also at lines and polygons.
* Support Dynamic View Annotations in SwiftUI.
* Add `MapboxMaps.camera(for:camera:coordinatesPadding:maxZoom:offset)`.
* Add `MapViewDebugOptions.padding` debug option.
* Add `maxZoom` and `offset` parameters to `OverviewViewportStateOptions`.

### Bug fixes üêû

* Fix issue when transition to Overview Viewport resulted in double padding.
* [SwiftUI] Fix issue when Overview Viewport is incorrect if set as initial viewport.

## 11.0.0-beta.5 - 9 October, 2023

* Add a new CustomLayer API to simplify manipulation of layers with custom rendering (aka "CustomLayerHost").
* The following APIs have been promoted to stable:
  - `LineLayer/lineDepthOcclusionFactor`, `LineLayer/lineDepthOcclusionFactorTransition`, `LineLayer/lineEmissiveStrength` and `LineLayer/lineEmissiveStrengthTransition`
  - `SymbolLayer/iconImageCrossFade`, `SymbolLayer/iconImageCrossFadeTransition`, `SymbolLayer/iconEmissiveStrength`, `SymbolLayer/iconEmissiveStrengthTransition`, `SymbolLayer/textEmissiveStrength` and `SymbolLayer/textEmissiveStrengthTransition`
  - `BackgroundLayer/backgroundEmissiveStrength` and `BackgroundLayer/backgroundEmissiveStrengthTransition`
  - `CircleLayer/circleEmissiveStrength` and `CircleLayer/circleEmissiveStrengthTransition`
  - `FillLayer/fillEmissiveStrength` and `FillLayer/fillEmissiveStrengthTransition`
  - `AmbientLight`, `DirectionalLight` and related APIs.
* Fix memory leak in SwiftUI.
* Expose `MapViewDebugOptions` in SwiftUI.

## 11.0.0-beta.4 - 20 September, 2023

### Breaking changes ‚ö†Ô∏è

* `StyleColor.red`, `StyleColor.green`, `StyleColor.blue`, `StyleColor.alpha` are not in use anymore and got removed.
* The `syncSourceAndLayerIfNeeded` method in every annotation manager (e.g`PointAnnotationManager` and others) was removed from the public API.

### Features ‚ú® and improvements üèÅ

* Add MSAA support with the `MapInitOptions/antialiasingSampleCount` property.
* `StyleColor` - add support for all color formats as defined by [Mapbox Style Spec](https://docs.mapbox.com/style-spec/reference/types/#color).
* Introduce experimental Custom Raster Source APIs: `StyleManager/addCustomRasterSource`, `StyleManager/setCustomRasterSourceTileData`, `StyleManager/invalidateCustomRasterSourceTile`, `StyleManager/invalidateCustomRasterSourceRegion`.
* Introduce new Map Content Gesture System.
* Add an experimental `MapView/cameraDebugOverlay` which returns a UIView displaying the current state of the camera.
* Add `MapView/debugOptions` which wraps the debugOptions on the underlying map in `MapViewDebugOptions`. An additional `.camera` debug option has been added, which adds a `CameraDebugView` to the map to see the current camera state. `MapboxMap/debugOptions` has been deprecated; access the underlying map debug options through `mapView.debugOptions.nativeDebugOptions` instead.

## 11.0.0-beta.3 - 8 September, 2023

### Breaking changes ‚ö†Ô∏è

* `MapboxMap.dragStart()` and `MapboxMap.dragEnd()` are not in use anymore and got removed.
* Remove `MapOptions/optimizeForTerrain` option. Whenever terrain is present layer order is automatically adjusted for better performance.

### Features ‚ú® and improvements üèÅ

* Improve map camera and gestures when terrain is used to fix camera bumpiness and map flickering.
* Expose a method to remove tile region with a completion: `TileStore.removeTileRegion(forId:completion:)`.
* Bump core maps version to 11.0.0-beta.4 and common sdk to 24.0.0-beta.4.

### Bug fixes üêû

* Fix `modelCastShadows` and `modelReceiveShadows` options of `Puck3DConfiguration` being ignored.
* Fix `StyleColor` failing to initialize with non-sRGB color spaces by converting supplied `UIColor`s to `sRGB` color space by default.

## 11.0.0-beta.2 - 23 August, 2023

* Introduce experimental `MapboxRecorder`, which allows recording of the map and replaying custom scenarios.
* Expose `slot` property on `Layer` protocol.
* Bump core maps version to 11.0.0-beta.3 and common sdk to 24.0.0-beta.3.
* Add privacy policy attribution dialog action.

## 11.0.0-beta.1 - 2 August, 2023

* Introduce `hsl`, `hsla` color expression.
* Introduce `random` expression.
* Introduce `measureLight` expression lights configuration property.
* Introduce `LineLayer/lineBorderColor`, `LineLayer/lineBorderWidth` APIs.
* Introduce `SymbolLayer/iconImageCrossFade` API.
* Introduce experimental `BackgroundLayer/backgroundEmissiveStrength`, `CircleLayer/circleEmissiveStrength`, `FillLayer/fillEmissiveStrength`, `LineLayer/lineEmissiveStrength`, `SymbolLayer/iconEmissiveStrength`, `SymbolLayer/textEmissiveStrength`, `ModelLayer/modelEmissiveStrength`, `ModelLayer/modelRoughness`, `ModelLayer/modelHeightBasedEmissiveStrengthMultiplier` APIs.
* Introduce experimental `FillExtrusionLayer/fillExtrusionAmbientOcclusionWallRadius`, `FillExtrusionLayer/fillExtrusionAmbientOcclusionGroundRadius`, `FillExtrusionLayer/fillExtrusionAmbientOcclusionGroundAttenuation`, `FillExtrusionLayer/fillExtrusionFloodLightColor`, `FillExtrusionLayer/fillExtrusionFloodLightIntensity`, `FillExtrusionLayer/fillExtrusionFloodLightWallRadius`, `FillExtrusionLayer/fillExtrusionFloodLightGroundRadius`, `FillExtrusionLayer/fillExtrusionFloodLightGroundAttenuation`, `FillExtrusionLayer/fillExtrusionVerticalScale` APIs.
* Rename `Viewport` to `ViewportManager`.
* Apply `ModelScaleMode.viewport` to Puck3D configuration and remove the custom expression for the `modelScale` of the puck. This means if you are using a constant for `Puck3DConfiguration/modelScale` in v10, you need to adjust this model-scale constant so the puck would be rendered correctly in v11, while this value depends on other configurations of your puck, we have found the new adjusted model-scale to fall between 10x-100x of the old value.
* Add experimental `tileCover` method to the `Snapshotter` that returns tile ids covering the map.
* Add optional `maxZoom` and `offset` parameters to `MapboxMap.camera(for coordinateBounds:)`. `MapboxMap.camera(for coordinateBounds:)`, `MapboxMap.camera(for coordinates:)`, and `MapboxMap.camera(for geometry:)` no longer return a padding value.
* `Location` is splitted into `Location` and `Heading` structs, the location and heading data are now animated individually.
* Replace `loadStyleJSON(_:completion:)`/`loadStyleJSON(_:completion:)` with overloaded `loadStyle(_:completion:)`.
* Mark `Expression.Operator.activeAnchor` as experimental.
* Add transition options as a parameter to `loadStyle(...)` methods.
* `Expression.Operator` is now a struct with static variables instead of enum.
* Add `MapboxMap.coordinate(s)Info(for:)` for converting offscreen points into geographical coordinates.
* Fixed an issue when `MapboxMap.point(for:)` could return false negative result.
* Remove `source`, `sourceLayer`, `filter` properties from the `Layer` protocol requirement.
* Bump core maps version to 11.0.0-beta.1.
* Refactor style Light API: introduce `AmbientLight`, `DirectionalLight`, `FlatLight` and methods to set them.
* Add expression support to `Layer.visibility`.
* Expose new APIs for working with style importing and configuration: getStyleImports(), removeStyleImport(forImportId:), getStyleImportSchema(forImportId:), getStyleImportConfigProperties(forImportId:), setStyleImportConfigPropertiesForImportId(_:configs:), getStyleImportConfigProperty(forImportId:config:), setStyleImportConfigPropertyForImportId(_:config:value:)
* Expose `slot` property for all `Layer`s to link layers from imported styles.
* Convert Style properties enums into structs.
* Bump core maps version to 11.0.0-beta.2 and common sdk to 24.0.0-beta.2.
* Remove MetaKit reexport.

* Remove unnecessary check before updating a geo json source.
* Remove deprecated `LocationManager.updateHeadingForCurrentDeviceOrientation()` method.
* Remove deprecated `MapEvents.EventKind`.
* Make NSNumber extension internal.
* Remove experimental `MapboxMap.setRenderCache(_:)` method.
* Remove deprecated `GestureOptions.pinchRotateEnabled`.
* Remove deprecated `Location` initializer.
* Remove deprecated transition properties from layers.
* Make `easeTo/flyTo` return non-optional cancelable token.
* Add `rotation` case to `GestureType` to be able to detect rotation separately from other gestures.
* Enable zoom during a drag gesture.
* Fix bearing value is fluctuating between initial value and correct value during a rotation gesture.
* Allows animation during any ongoing gestures.
* Sync map size to the size of the metal view.
* Fix missing feature properties for `nil`/`null` values.
* Added experimental `tileCover` method to `MapboxMap` that returns tile ids covering the map.
* Expose `owner` property for `CameraAnimator` protocol
* Updated core styles to the latest versions.
* Merge `TilesetDescriptorOptions` and `TilesetDescriptorOptionsForTilesets`. To enable tileset descriptor creation for a list of tilesets that are not part of the original style use `TilesetDescriptorOptions`.
* Use `DataRef` to pass snapshot and style image data by reference, improving performance
* Bumped min iOS version to 12.0
* Expose a subset of ModelLayer APIs.
* Protocol `LocationProvider` now requires class semantic for implementation.
* The Map events have been reworked:
  - Now all Map events payloads are serialize-free, which brings more type safety and eliminates possible deserialization errors;
  - The `MapboxMap` and `Snapshotter` now expose `on`-prefixed properties that allows you to subscribe to map events via `observe` and `observeNext` methods:
    ```swift
    mapboxMap.onCameraChanged.observe { [weak self] event in
      self?.camera = event.cameraState
    }.store(in: &cancelables)

    mapboxMap.onStyleLoaded.observeNext { [weak self] _ in
      self?.configureStyle()
    }.store(in: &cancelables)
    ```
  - The `AnyCancelable` object returned from `observe` and `observeNext` should be stored, otherwise the subscription will be immediately canceled;
  - The same `on`-prefixed properties can now be used as `Combine.Publisher`:
    ```swift
    import Combine
    mapboxMap.onCameraChanged
      .debounce(for: .milliseconds(500), scheduler: DispatchQueue.main)
      .map(\.cameraState)
      .sink { [weak self] cameraState in
        self?.camera = cameraState
      }.store(in: &cancellables)
    ```
  - Methods `MapboxMap.onEvery`, `MapboxMap.onNext`, `Snapshotter.onEvery`, `Snapshotter.onNext` have been deprecated;
  - Methods `MapboxMap.observe` and `Snapshotter.observe` have been removed.
* Deprecate `PointAnnotationManager.iconTextFit` and `PointAnnotationManager.iconTextFitPadding` in favor of `PointAnnotation.iconTextFit` and `PointAnnotation.iconTextFitPadding`.
* Remove deprecated `PuckBearingSource`and related APIs.
* Experimental API `MapboxMap/setMemoryBudget` was renamed to `MapboxMaps/setTileCacheBudget` and promoted to stable.
* Location consumer methods have been renamed to align with Swift API Design Guidelines. Use `addLocationConsumer(_:)` and `removeLocationConsumer(_:)` rather than `addLocationConsumer(newConsumer:)` and `removeLocationConsumer(consumer:)`.
* `SourceType` and `LayerType` are now structs with static variables instead of enums
* Remove `ResourceOptions` and `ResourceOptionsManager`. Introduce `MapboxOptions` and `MapboxMapsOptions` to handle application-level access token and other generic options.
  - Mapbox's access token can now be set with `MapboxCommon.MapboxOptions`. By default, MapboxMaps SDK will try to read the access token from app bundle's property list or `MapboxAccessToken` file when Maps service are initialized; if you wish to set access token programmatically, it is highly recommended to set it before initializing a `MapView`.
    ```swift
    import MapboxMaps

    MapboxOptions.accessToken = accessToken
    ```
  - `TileStore`no longer requires `TileStoreOptions.mapboxAccessToken` to be explicitly set.
  - Configurations for the external resources used by Maps API can now be set with `MapboxMapsOptions`:
    ```swift
    import MapboxMaps

    MapboxMapsOptions.dataPath = customDataPathURL
    MapboxMapsOptions.assetPath = customAssetPathURL
    MapboxMapsOptions.tileStoreUsageMode = .readOnly
    MapboxMapsOptions.tileStore = tileStore
    ```
  - To clear the temporary map data, you can use `MapboxMap.clearData(completion:)`
* Expose new 3D Lights API: `AmbientLight` and `DirectionalLight`.
* `TypeConversionError`, `SnapshotError`, and `ViewAnnotationManagerError` are now structs with static variables instead of enums
* Extend `Layer` protocol with `visibility` property.
* Add required `id` property to `Source`. After that change `id` should be specified for source upon creation:
  ```swift
  let terrainSource = RasterDemSource(id: "terrain-source")
  mapView.mapboxMap.addSource(terrainSource)
  ```
* Support string option in `GeoJSONSourceData`.
* Allows passing `extraOptions` (which must be a valid JSON object) when creating `StylePackLoadOptions`and `TilesetDescriptorOptions`.
* Deprecate `MapboxMap/style` and `Snapshotter/style`, from now on you can access Style APIs directly from `MapboxMap` and `Snapshotter` instance.
* Add a new API to enable Tracing with `Tracing.status = .enabled`. Checkout `Tracing` reference to see more.
* Introduce `FillExtrusionLayer.fillExtrusionRoundedRoof` , `FillExtrusionLayer.fillExtrusionEdgeRadius` API.
* Introduce `line-depth-occlusion` API.
* Introduce `FillExtrusionLayer/fillExtrusionRoundedRoof`, `FillExtrusionLayer/fillExtrusionEdgeRadius` API.
* Introduce `lineDepthOcclusionFactor` API for `LineLayer`s and `PolylineAnnotiationManager`.
* Add `Codable` support to `CameraOptions`, `CameraState`, `FollowPuckViewportStateBearing`, `FollowPuckViewportStateOptions`.
* Expose new Style APIs for partial GeoJSON update:
```swift
MapboxMap.addGeoJSONSourceFeatures(forSourceId:features:dataId:)
MapboxMap.updateGeoJSONSourceFeatures(forSourceId:features:dataId:)
MapboxMap.removeGeoJSONSourceFeatures(forSourceId:featureIds:dataId:)
```

* `public func updateLayer<T: Layer>(withId id: String, update: (inout T) throws -> Void) throws` has been updated to `public func updateLayer<T>(withId id: String, type: T.Type, update: (inout T) throws -> Void) throws where T: Layer`. ([#694](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/694))
* `public func source<T: Source>(withId id: String) throws -> T` has been updated to `public func source<T>(withId id: String, type: T.Type) throws -> T where T: Source`. ([#694](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/694))
* `@_spi(Experimental) public func layer(withId id: String, type: Layer.Type) throws -> Layer` is no longer experimental and has been updated to `public func layer(withId id: String) throws -> Layer`. ([#694](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/694))
* `@_spi(Experimental) public func source(withId id: String, type: Source.Type) throws  -> Source` is no longer experimental and has been updated to `public func source(withId id: String) throws  -> Source`. ([#694](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/694))
* `GestureManagerDelegate.gestureBegan(for:)` has been renamed to `GestureManagerDelegate.gestureManager(_:didBegin:)`. ([#697](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/697))
* Added the public delegate methods `GestureManagerDelegate.gestureManager(_:didEnd:willAnimate:)` and `GestureManagerDelegate.gestureManager(_:didEndAnimatingFor:)`. ([#697](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/697))
* Converts `PointAnnotation.Image` from an `enum` to a `struct`. ([#707](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/707))
* Removes `PointAnnotation.Image.default`. ([#707](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/707))
* Replaces `PointAnnotation.Image.custom` with `PointAnnotation.Image.init(image:name:)`. ([#707](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/707))
* The `tapGestureRecognizer` var on each `*AnnotationManager` has been removed in favor of a unified tap gesture recognizer available at `GestureManager.singleTapGestureRecognizer`([#709](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/709)).

* Renames `Style.updateGeoJSONSource<T: GeoJSONObject>(withId:geoJSON:)` to `Style.updateGeoJSONSource(withId:geoJSON:)`. Instead of passing in the expected GeoJSON object type, you perform pattern matching on the return value using `case let`. ([#715](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/715))
* Setting `data` property on a GeoJSON source via `Style.setSourceProperty(for:property:value:)` or `Style.updateGeoJSONSource(withId:geoJSON:)` is now asynchronous and never returns an error. Errors will be reported asynchronously via a `MapEvents.EventKind.mapLoadingError` event instead. ([#732](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/732))
* Core and Common APIs that accept user-defined implementations of protocols now hold strong references to the provided objects. Please audit your usage of the following protocols and make any required changes to avoid memory leaks: `CustomLayerHost`, `ElevationData`, `MapClient`, `MBMMetalViewProvider`, `Observer`, `OfflineRegionObserver`, `HttpServiceInterceptorInterface`, `HttpServiceInterface`, `LogWriterBackend`, `OfflineSwitchObserver`, `ReachabilityInterface`, `TileStoreObserver`. ([#732](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/732))
* Extends `OfflineRegionGeometryDefinition.geometry` to use `Geometry` rather than `MapboxCommon.Geometry`. It also adds a convenience initializer that takes a `Geometry`. ([#706](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/706))
* Annotation managers are now kept alive by the `AnnotationOrchestrator` (`MapView.annotations`) until they are explicitly destroyed by calling `mapView.annotations.removeAnnotationManager(withId:)` or are implicitly destroyed by creating a second annotation manager with the same ID. ([#725](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/725))
* The `AnnotationManager` protocol now conforms to `AnyObject`. ([#725](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/725))
* `PreferredFPS` has been removed. `MapView.preferredFramesPerSecond` now of type `Int`, rather than `PreferredFPS`. ([#735](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/735))
* `QueriedFeature.feature` is no longer optional. ([#737](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/737))
* `TypeConversionError` has a new case `unsuccessfulConversion`. ([#737](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/737))

### Features ‚ú® and improvements üèÅ

* `TileRegionLoadOptions` exposes its geometry as a `Geometry`. ([#711](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/711))
* Adds `FeatureExtensionValue.init(value: Any?, features: [Feature]?)` that works with Turf. ([#717](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/717))
* Adds `FeatureExtensionValue.features: [Feature]?` that works with Turf. ([#717](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/717))
* APIs that accept Turf `Feature` now allow `Feature.identifier` and `.properties` to be `nil`. ([#717](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/717))
* APIs that accept Turf `Feature` now ignore `Feature.properties` instead of crashing if it cannot be converted to `[String: NSObject]`. ([#717](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/717))
* Any touch event in the map now immediately disables camera animation. Temporarily disable user interaction on the `MapView` to disable this behavior as needed. ([#712](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/712))
* `BasicCameraAnimator` no longer updates the camera a final time after being stopped or canceled prior to running to completion. ([#712](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/712))
* `BasicCameraAnimator.isReversed` is now settable. ([#712](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/712))
* The double tap, quick zoom, and double touch gestures now use the gesture's location in the view to anchor camera changes. Previously, they used the camera's center coordinate. ([#722](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/722))
* `MapboxCommon.HTTPServiceFactory.reset()` has been added to release the HTTP service implementation. ([#732](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/732))
* `AnnotationOrchestrator.annotationManagersById` has been added. This dictionary contains all annotation managers that have not been removed. ([#725](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/725))
* Adds the `ExpressionArgument.geoJSONObject(_:)` case, which allows you to include a `Turf.GeoJSONObject` instance in an expression with the `Expression.Operator.distance` or `Expression.Operator.within` operator. ([#730](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/730))
* Adds `MapView.preferredFrameRateRange` for devices using iOS 15.0 and up. ([#735](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/735))
* Adds `TileStore.subscribe(_:)` which can be used to observe a `TileStore`'s activity. The API design deviates from Android's add/remove observer API so that the developer-provided `TileStoreObserver` can be wrapped into a `MapboxCommon_Private.TileStoreObserver` without needing to use global state or something like Objective-C associated objects to look up which wrapper goes with with developer-provided observer when calling `__removeObserver`. ([#737](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/737))
* Adds `TileStoreObserver` protocol. ([#737](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/737))

## 10.0.0-rc.2 - June 23, 2021

### Features ‚ú® and improvements üèÅ

* Introduced experimental `Style._addPersistentLayer(with:layerPosition:)`, `Style._isPersistentLayer(id:)`, `Style._addPersistentCustomLayer(withId:layerHost:layerPosition:)` APIs, so that the tagged layer and its associated resources remain when a style is reloaded. This improves performance of annotations during a style change. Experimental APIs should be considered liable to change in any SEMVER version. ([#471](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/471), [#473](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/473))
- Annotations now will persist across style changes by default. ([#475](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/475))
- Adds localization support for v10 Maps SDK. This can be used by setting the `mapView.locale`. Use the `SupportedLanguages` enum, which lists currently supported `Locale`. ([#480](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/480))

### Breaking changes ‚ö†Ô∏è

- `camera(for:)` methods have moved from `BaseMapView` to `MapboxMap` ([#286](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/286))
  * The API has also been aligned with Android by:
      * Removing default values for parameters
      * Making `bearing` and `pitch` parameters optional
      * Adding the `camera(for:camera:rect:)` variant
- `OrnamentOptions` should now be accessed via `MapView.ornaments.options`. `MapConfig.ornaments` has been removed. Updates can be applied directly to `OrnamentsManager.options`. Previously the map's ornament options were updated on `MapConfig.ornaments` with `MapView.update`. ([#310](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/310))
- `OrnamentOptions` now uses structs to manage options for individual ornaments. For example, `OrnamentOptions.scaleBarPosition` is now `OrnamentOptions.scaleBar.position`. ([#318](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/318))
- The `LogoView` class is now private. ([#310](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/310))
- `Style` has been significantly refactored, for example:
  - Synchronous APIs returning `Result` types now throw.
  - A number of APIs previously accessed via `__map` are now available via the `Style` object.
  - APIs with a `get` prefix have been renamed; for example `getLayer<T>(with:type:)` to `layer<T>(withId:type:) throws` and `getSource<T>(id:type:)` to `source<T>(withId:type:) throws`

### Features ‚ú® and improvements üèÅ

- `OrnamentsManager` is now a public class and can be accessed via the `MapView`'s `ornaments` property.
- `CompassDirectionFormatter` is now public. It provides a string representation of a `CLLocationDirection` and supports the same languages as in pre-v10 versions of the Maps SDK. ([#300](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/300))- `OrnamentOptions` should now be accessed via `MapView.ornaments.options`. Updates can be applied directly to the `options` property. Previously the map's ornament options were updated via `MapConfig.ornaments`. ([#310](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/310))
- The `LogoView` class is now private. ([#310](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/310))

## 10.0.0-beta.18.1 - April 28, 2021

### Breaking changes ‚ö†Ô∏è

- #### Camera Animations
  * A new `CameraTransition` struct has been introduced to allow better control on the "from" and "to" values of a camera animation ([#282](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/282))
     * A mutable version of the `CameraTransition` struct is passed into every animation block.
  * Animations can only be constructor injected into `CameraAnimator` as part of the `makeAnimator*` methods on `mapView.camera`.
  * The `makeCameraAnimator*` methods have been renamed to `makeAnimator*` methods

- #### Gestures
  - Gestures now directly call `__map.setCamera()` instead of using CoreAnimation

## 10.0.0-beta.18 - April 23, 2021

### Breaking changes ‚ö†Ô∏è

- #### `MapView`
  * The initializer has changed to `public init(frame: CGRect, mapInitOptions: MapInitOptions = MapInitOptions(), styleURI: StyleURI? = .streets)`.
  * `MapOptions` has been renamed `MapConfig`. A new `MapOptions` has been introduced; its properties are required to initialize the underlying map object.
  * A `MapInitOptions` configuration struct has been introduced. It currently wraps both `ResourceOptions` and `MapOptions` and is used when initializing a `MapView`.
  * `baseURL` and `accessToken` can no longer be set from a nib or storyboard. Instead a new `MapInitOptionsProvider` protocol and an `IBOutlet` on `MapView` has been introduced to allow a customer `MapInitOptions` to be provided to the `MapView`. This provider is not used when initializing a `MapView` programmatically.
  * The `Manager` suffix has been removed from `MapView.gesturesManager`, `MapView.ornamentsManager`, `MapView.cameraManager`, `MapView.locationManager`, and `MapView.annotationsManager`.
  * `BaseMapView.camera` has been renamed to `BaseMapView.cameraOptions`.

- #### Foundation
  * `AccountManager` has been removed. A new `CredentialsManager` replaces it. You can use `CredentialsManager.default` to set a global access token.
  * MapboxCoreMaps protocol conformances have been encapsulated. ([#265](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/265))
      * `ObserverConcrete` has been removed.
      * `BaseMapView` no longer conforms to `MapClient` or `MBMMetalViewProvider`, and the methods they required are now internal.
      * The setter for `BaseMapView.__map` is now private
      * `Snapshotter` no longer conforms to `Observer`, and the method it required is now internal.
  * The `BaseMapView.__map` property has been moved to `BaseMapView.mapboxMap.__map`. ([#280](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/280))
  * A `CameraOptions` struct has been introduced. This shadows the class of the same name from MapboxCoreMaps and. This avoids unintended sharing and better reflects the intended value semantics of the `CameraOptions` concept. ([#284](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/284))

- #### Dependencies
  * Updated dependencies to MapboxCoreMaps 10.0.0-beta.20 and MapboxCommon 11.0.1
  * ResourceOptions now contains a `TileStore` instance. Tile store usage is enabled by default, the resource option `tileStoreEnabled` flag is introduced to disable it.
  * `TileStore` no longer returns cached responses for 401, 403 and unauthorized requests.
  * Fixed a bug where `TileStore` would not invoke completion closures (when client code did not keep a strong reference to the tile store instance).


### Features ‚ú® and improvements üèÅ

- Introduced the `OfflineManager` API that manages style packs and produces tileset descriptors for use with the tile store. The `OfflineManager` and `TileStore` APIs are used in conjunction to download offline regions and associated "style packs". These new APIs replace the deprecated `OfflineRegionManager`. Please see the new `OfflineManager` guide for more details.

### Bug fixes üêû

- Fixed a crash in line layer rendering, where the uniform buffer size had an incorrect value.

- `AnnotationSupportableMap` is now internal ([#246](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/246))

- #### MapView
    * Initializer has been changed to `public init(frame: CGRect, resourceOptions: ResourceOptions, glyphsRasterizationOptions: GlyphsRasterizationOptions = GlyphsRasterizationOptions.default, styleURI: StyleURI? = .streets)`.
    * `StyleURL` has been renamed to `StyleURI`
    * `OrnamentSupportableMapView` is not internal.

- #### Ornaments
    * `LayoutPosition` has been deprecated in favor of `OrnamentPosition`.
    * `LayoutVisibility` has been deprecated in favor of `OrnamentVisibility`.
    * `showsLogoView` has been renamed to `_showsLogoView`.
    * `showsCompass` and `showsScale` have been deprecated. Visibility properties can be used to set how the Compass and Scale Bar should be shown.

- #### Foundation
    * `cancelTransitions` has been renamed to `cancelAnimations`.
    * [`setCamera()`](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/250/files#diff-8fa667141ac423a208a6e7036ed759e7e52fc6940bd58834c1935c2c6ead9c65L177) with individual parameters has been deprecated in favor of [`setCamera(to targetCamera: CameraOptions...)`](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/blob/edbf08e37975c81c7ee1cbc4bb046c48d522d306/Sources/MapboxMaps/Foundation/Camera/CameraManager.swift#L140) which requires `CameraOptions`.
    * The following camera convenience functions have been removed:
        * `public func transitionCoordinateBounds(newCoordinateBounds: CoordinateBounds, animated: Bool = false)`
        * `public func transitionCoordinateBounds(to newCoordinateBounds: CoordinateBounds, edgePadding: UIEdgeInsets, animated: Bool = false, completion: ((UIViewAnimatingPosition) -> Void)? = nil)`
        * `public func transitionVisibleCoordinates(newCoordinates: [CLLocationCoordinate2D], edgePadding: UIEdgeInsets, animated: Bool = false)`
        * `public func transitionVisibleCoordinates(to newCoordinates: [CLLocationCoordinate2D], edgePadding: UIEdgeInsets, bearing: CLLocationDirection, duration: TimeInterval, animated: Bool = false, completion: ((UIViewAnimatingPosition) -> Void)? = nil)`
        * `public func resetPosition()`
        * `public func resetNorth(_ animated: Bool = false)`
    * In `CameraAnimator`, `fractionComplete` is now of type `Double` and `delayFactor` now returns a `Double`.
    * `MapboxLogoView` has been renamed to `LogoView`.
    * `MapboxLogoSize` has been renamed to `LogoSize`.

- #### Style
    * Initializer is now marked as internal.
    * `styleUri` property has been renamed to `uri`.
    * The `url` property from `StyleURL` has been removed.

- #### Expressions
    * `init(from: jsonObject)` and `public func jsonObject()` have been removed.
    * `Element.op` has been renamed to `Element.operator`.
    * `Argument.array` has been renamed to `Argument.numberArray`.
    * `ValidExpressionArgument` has been renamed to `ExpressionArgumentConvertible`

* Developers should make camera changes directly to `MapView`'s camera
  properties. Previously, changes could be applied to `MapView.cameraView`. ([#217](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/pull/217))
* `CameraAnimator` objects are managed by developers and should be stored by
  developers to prevent the animations from falling out of scope.
