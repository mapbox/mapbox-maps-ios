Copyright © 2021 Mapbox

All rights reserved.

Mapbox Maps for iOS version 10.0 (“Mapbox Maps iOS SDK”) or higher must be used according to the Mapbox Terms of Service. This license allows developers with a current active Mapbox account to use and modify the Mapbox Maps iOS SDK. Developers may modify the Mapbox Maps iOS SDK code so long as the modifications do not change or interfere with marked portions of the code related to billing, accounting, and anonymized data collection. The Mapbox Maps iOS SDK sends anonymized location and usage data, which Mapbox uses for fixing bugs and errors, accounting, and generating aggregated anonymized statistics. This license terminates automatically if a user no longer has an active Mapbox account.

For the full license terms, please see the Mapbox Terms of Service at https://www.mapbox.com/legal/tos/
