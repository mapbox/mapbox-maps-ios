The Mapbox Maps SDK for iOS is a public library for displaying interactive, thoroughly customizable maps in native iOS. It takes map styles that conform to the [Mapbox Style Specification](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/style-spec/), applies them to vector tiles that conform to the [Mapbox Vector Tile Specification](https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec), and renders them using Metal.
