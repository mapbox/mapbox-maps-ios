# Phases are collection of commands that get executed on Device Farm.
phases:
  # The install phase includes commands that install dependencies that your tests use.
  # Default dependencies for testing frameworks supported on Device Farm are already installed.
  install:
    commands:
      # - XCODE_VERSION=$(xcodebuild -version |head -n 1|cut -d" " -f2|cut -d"." -f1)
      # - >-
      #  if [ "$XCODE_VERSION" -lt 12 ];
      #  then
      #    echo "Xcode version is $XCODE_VERSION; switching to a higher version";
      #    sudo /usr/bin/xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/;
      #    xcodebuild -version;
      #  fi;

  # The pre-test phase includes commands that setup your test environment.
  pre_test:
    commands:
      # The xctestrun file contains the following line
      #
      #   __TESTROOT__/Release-iphoneos/MobileMetrics.app
      #
      # where __TESTROOT__ is the directory where the xctestrun file lives.
      # The following recreates that hierarchy, based on the IPA that was uploaded (the testrun
      # file is included in the app package.)
      - mkdir -p /tmp/test-root/Release-iphoneos
      - mkdir -p /tmp/build

      - unzip $DEVICEFARM_TEST_PACKAGE_PATH -d /tmp/unzipped-ipa
      - cp -R /tmp/unzipped-ipa/Payload/MobileMetrics.app /tmp/test-root/Release-iphoneos
      - mv /tmp/test-root/Release-iphoneos/MobileMetrics.app/*.xctestrun /tmp/test-root
      - xcodebuild -version


  # The test phase includes commands that run your test suite execution.
  test:
    commands:
      - cd /tmp/test-root && xcodebuild test-without-building -destination id=$DEVICEFARM_DEVICE_UDID -xctestrun *.xctestrun      -derivedDataPath /tmp/build -resultBundlePath /tmp/build/metrics.xcresult

  # The post test phase includes are commands that are run after your tests are executed.
  post_test:
    commands:
      # We created a separate /tmp/build directory as we were seeing some "permission denied" errors
      # with the xcresult package (resulting in an essentially empty result folder).
      - cp -R /tmp/build $DEVICEFARM_LOG_DIR
      - mkdir ~/ios-documents
      - ifuse ~/ios-documents --documents com.mapbox.MobileMetrics
      - cp -R ~/ios-documents $DEVICEFARM_LOG_DIR
      - chmod -R 777 $DEVICEFARM_LOG_DIR

# The artifacts phase lets you specify the location where your tests logs, device logs will be stored.
# And also let you specify the location of your test logs and artifacts which you want to be collected by Device Farm.
# These logs and artifacts will be available through ListArtifacts API in Device Farm.
artifacts:
  # By default, Device Farm will collect your artifacts from following directories
  - $DEVICEFARM_LOG_DIR

  # This appears necessary, even though it is specified on the schedule-run command-line
  - Documents
