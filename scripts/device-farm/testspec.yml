# Phases are collection of commands that get executed on Device Farm.

  # The install phase includes commands that install dependencies that your
  # tests use. Default dependencies for testing frameworks supported on Device
  # Farm are already installed.
  install:

  # The pre-test phase includes commands that setup your test environment.
  pre_test:
    commands:
      # The xctestrun file contains the following line
      #
      #   __TESTROOT__/Release-iphoneos/<app-to-test>.app
      #
      # where __TESTROOT__ is the directory where the xctestrun file lives.
      # The following recreates that hierarchy, based on the IPA that was
      # uploaded (the testrun file is included in the app package.)
      # - ls -laR $DEVICEFARM_TEST_PACKAGE_PATH
      - mkdir -p /tmp/test-root
      - unzip $DEVICEFARM_TEST_PACKAGE_PATH -d /tmp/unzipped-ipa
      - mv /tmp/unzipped-ipa/Payload/*.app/xctestrun.zip /tmp/xctestrun.zip

  # The test phase includes commands that run your test suite execution.
  test:
    commands:
      # TODO: Investigate -resultBundlePath
      - xcodebuild -version

# The artifacts phase lets you specify the location where your tests logs,
# device logs will be stored. And also let you specify the location of your test
# logs and artifacts which you want to be collected by Device Farm. These logs
# and artifacts will be available through ListArtifacts API in Device Farm.
artifacts:
  # By default, Device Farm will collect your artifacts from following
  # directories
  - $DEVICEFARM_LOG_DIR
  # This appears necessary, even though it is specified on the schedule-run
